Artificial disease progression model simulation
Algorithm was simple
* Deterime an nonlinear deterministic disease prgression model for the placebo group. Get treatment group by reducing the model by some percentage. 
* Plans to generated longitudinal data from the model for treated and palcebo group for 5 time points
* Generate Multivariate normal for each of the time point with mean 0, diseared variance and correlation matrix 
* Add the normal error to the deterministic model
* Run statistical models to see whether it can detect the desired difference between placebo and treatment

Learning: 
1. Each time the algorithm producing same estimate repeatedly. After a long investigation I realized, I set seed to null and solved the issue forever. For reproducibility, it would be better to use a series of random number seed for each iteration.
2. I am not sure why that solved the problem as this is the first time. However, microsoft co-pilot has some thought on it thought does not completely make sense. It took couple of day to find the solution.

"When you use set.seed(NULL), it initializes the random number generator with a seed based on the current time and process ID, which ensures that you get different random numbers 
each time you run your code1. This is why you observed different random numbers after using set.seed(NULL).
Without explicitly setting a seed, R uses the current state of the random number generator, which can sometimes result in the same sequence of random numbers 
if the state hasn't changed significantly between runs. By setting the seed to NULL, you force R to use a new, unpredictable seed each time, ensuring variability in the generated random numbers."
